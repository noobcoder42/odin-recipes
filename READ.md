For this project I will be working on creating a HTML recipes webpage. This project is from The Odin Project course at the Foundation level. 

Before starting the Odin Project I also did the FreecodeCamp Responsive Web Design Coure and completed it back in 2021. I am quite confident at where I am when it comes to my knowledge of HTML. 

This project will further improve my foundations when it comes to fully utilising HTML in the future.
